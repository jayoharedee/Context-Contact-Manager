# Context Contact Manager

This is just a project I'm using to become familiar with and learn React's Context API.

## Getting Started

## Built With

* [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) - Started this project here and exported here to track upcoming features
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Used for a starting point for this project
* [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) - UI components are based out of this library to focus more on the Context API and less on styles as it's not the objective here
